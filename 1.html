Hi. I'm jisu. I'm in middle of studying about web with my glasses on.
I wanna create <u>my web pages</u>. I'm telling you, <strong>I'm gonna make it!</strong>
Do you wanna know that? I'm gonna let you know. You ready? C'mon!
<br><br>Today(lesson 2), I learned the 'TAG'. 'strong' means important things.
'u' means underline. so I think I can underline what I want the words.
'h1' is used in title. If the number would grow, the letters become smaller.
But you can use the number from 1 to 6.
<br><br>Today(lesson 3), I learned a new line. It is 'br' Let's try it.
You can see a line #5. I will use 'br' and then I'm gonna confirm if the web page
is created a new line or something. Oh, Isn't this amazing?
If you write 'br' more, there will be more gaps.
<p>I'm just about to cross my mind. 'br' is differnt from other tag. '/br' is not used.
also, you can use 'p'. 'p' is same 'br'. but one thing is different.
'p' uses '/p'.</p> Let's try it from #13 line. Are you done with this? how is it?
Although the function is same, but Using 'p' is better than 'br'.
but 'p' has a disadvantage. 'p' can make only one new line.
so If you wanna a number of new lines, 'p' is inefficient.
<p>Do you wanna insert a image? You can do this! 'img' can put what you want images.</p>

<center><img src="quibe.jpg" width="30%"></center>

<br>Today(lesson 4), I learned about list. you have to use 'li'.
'ul' is parents tag and 'li' is child tag. The result is same. 'ol' is also.
'ol' is able to create number. so you don't have to write number.
but 'ul' is not able to creat number. so you should write number by yourself.
'ul''s full name is Unordered List and 'ol''s full name is Ordered List.
<br>I also learned 'title'. It shows you web pages name.
'body' is main page(본문). 'head' and 'html' is absolutely necessary.
'meta charset="utf-8"' prevents 한글 from being broken.(한글깨짐방지)
<br>'a' is link. For example, Would you like to click this? ->
<a href="https://blog.naver.com/wltnsmsskek"
target="_blank" title="My blog">Everyday on a sketchbook</a>
If you wanna see a linked new page, you have to use 'target="_blank"'.
also If you wanna see a linked information, you have to use 'title='.
